            <h4>Information About Me</h4>
            <p>"Hello, I'm Tripti Khandelwal, a dedicated Jr. Frontend Developer with nearly 4 years of experience in the IT industry. My last work profile was as a Frontend Developer at Han River Technology until April 2024, where I contributed to various projects and enhanced my technical expertise.</p>
           
            <p>
              My journey into the tech world began with a aprox 1.5yr experience in
              UI Developer/designer at KDK Software. Before venturing into web
              development, I pursued Textile Designing from 2005 to 2008 and
              gained valuable experience as a Textile Merchandiser for 5 years
              (2008-2012). However, my passion for coding led me to invest the
              last 2 years in continuous learning through platforms like
              YouTube, Udemy, and free code certifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I have
              expanded my skillset to include modern front-end technologies. I
              am proficient in working with frameworks like React and Vue.js,
              enabling me to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces
              effectively. Additionally, I am well-versed in using design tools
              like Figma, allowing me to collaborate seamlessly with design
              teams and transform their ideas into exceptional user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my career, I have completed various certification
              courses to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
              best practices, ensuring that I deliver top-notch solutions for
              every project I work on. In the past, I also explored my teaching
              skills as a freelance teacher, which further solidified my
              understanding of the subjects and helped me become a more
              effective communicator and problem solver. I'm thrilled about the
              endless possibilities in the tech world, and I'm eager to
              collaborate on exciting projects and contribute my expertise in
              creating exceptional user experiences."

                    I bring significant expertise in ReactJS, Vue.js, and static HTML projects. I am adept at managing
                    complex designs, utilizing advanced CSS techniques such as grid, flexbox, positioning, and responsive
                    pseudo-elements to create engaging web experiences.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    My proficiency in React and Vue includes efficient routing management, dynamic accordion creation,
                    and JavaScript function implementation. My comprehensive knowledge of HTML ensures well
                    structured and semantic markup, promoting maintainability and performance.

                  <br />
                  <p>
                    I have a solid foundation in JavaScript, with experience in functions, DOM manipulation, and ES6
                    features. In React and Vue, I excel in developing intricate designs using props, slots, and components,
                    with a thorough understanding of hooks for effective state management and lifecycle handling.
